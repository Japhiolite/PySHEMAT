Examples to test PySHEMAT

simple_shemat_model_1.py:
Create a simple convection model, example from paper

simple_shemat_model_1_plot.py:
Calculate mean temperatures (z-direction) in simulated
model and create plot of results

To run these examples:
- copy in local directory and adjust path, if required;
- create the input file (.nml) with the first script,
- run simulation (e.g. from command line: change into directory
where .nml file is located and run command 'shemat'; make sure
that the path to the shemat executable is in the PATH environment
variable; for windows: adjust with:
Control Panel -> System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables)
(simulation should take several seconds only)
- After simulation: .nlo file should be created in directory, the
PERIOD1 folder contains a .vtk file of results, can be visualized with
any VTK viewer, e.g. the free program Mayavi
- run script simple_shemat_model_1_plot.py to create a png-plot
of mean temperatures in vertical direction, cleary showing the position
of the convection cells;
