PySHEMAT - Python wrapper for SHEMAT input and output files

PySHEMAT is a set of Python modules to simplify and automate input file generation and output file analysis for SHEMAT, a multi-purpose porous media flow simulation code (see below). The Python modules of PySHEMAT enable a full control of all simulation settings and rock parameters required for a simulation with SHEMAT. The main intention of these modules is to simplify and automate the model set-up. It is, for example, easily possible to create simple inversion routines or monte-carlo type parameter sweeps.

SHEMAT is a flow simulator for coupled fluid, heat and chemical transport in porous media. For more information see Clauser and Bartels, Numerical simulation of reactive flow in hot aquifers: SHEMAT and processing SHEMAT.
